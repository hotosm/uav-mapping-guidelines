     PacDID is a platform that leverages the OpenAerialMap (OAM) concept, making open imagery collected by satellites and UAVs easily available and accessible, particularly for the target audience in Pacific Island Countries. More information is available at Pacific Humanitarian Challenge (n.d.).

     Choosing a system that has been in use for many years and has a good track record—rather than a prototype or new system—is recommended. 

[^12]:

     Heavy platforms are not recommended for new or inexperienced pilots due to the higher risk these platforms present.

     The safety officer may be a third person, or one of the two pilots who takes on this additional role. The safety officer is responsible for ensuring all pre-flight checks are followed and that conditions to fly are appropriate (i.e., wind and cloud ceiling at minimum thresholds, clear skies). Depending on the procedures that have been agreed, the safety officer may also be responsible for communications with ATC for airspace deconfliction.
